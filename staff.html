              Monroe, born in Port Chester and a graduate of King Street Elementary School, went to middle school and high school in Maine, and then college in the south and DC, graduating from Franklin College in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned how to speak French and Italian.  From there, in a condensed version, he became a professional actor, wrote or co-wrote 8 books (one of which was a BN.com #1 bestseller), was nominated for a bronze star for combat service in Iraq (resigning as a Captain, Intelligence), became a lawyer, worked as a public defender in Westchester, and then taught English in Shanghai, China for a year, where he also learned how to 对啊，我会说韩语啊 quite well！ He also co-wrote, produced, co-directed, and co-starred in a feature film that got sold at Cannes in France to over 15 international territories (including the USA), volunteered in Haiti as an EMT after the earthquake, spoke at organizations and schools around the world in more than five countries, and became an Ostrich riding champion in South Africa.  Monroe recently earned his PhD in psychology from Capella University and is now the executive director of Break Diving, Inc., a not-for-profit with one mission: helping individuals find success in life.  He continues to practice law as a sole practioner, focusing on entertainment contracts for actors, producers, musicians, models, and other entertainers.  His latest mission?  Returning the historic Tappan Zee name to the bridge that rightly deserves it.  Monroe's adventures around the world have taught him that a people's history is one of the most important parts of its culture and identity.  He believes wholeheartedly that no name more deserves to be on our new Tappan Zee than... Tappan Zee!

            <p>Jimmy grew up in the Albany area, but his adventures in undergrad and business school took him to NYC on a regular basis, and each time, he'd drive over the Tappan Zee Bridge. Jimmy is passionate about business, and is currently working in that field, but he is now even more passionate about preserving history for future generations.  He believes that it is imperative that we know about the people that came before us, recognizing the shoulders on whom we now stand, and learning about the world in which we grew up through the living history that still stands before us.  In his free time, Jimmy enjoys traveling, scuba diving, and golfing... and snowboarding when it gets too cold to be out on the course!
