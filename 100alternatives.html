<h2>100 Viable Alternatives That TRULY Honor Mario Cuomo</h2>
<div class="well">    
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        
        <p>What follows is a growing list of alternatives to the recent renaming that we present to Albany, and each offers a way to honor Governor Mario Cuomo, while also preserving the historical name of the Tappan Zee Bridge that we all know, love, and have come to cherish.</p>
        <p>The list has started with a handful of suggestions, and 2 new alternatives will be added regularly until we reach (and surpass) 100.  Check back often for more!</p>
      </div>
        
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">        
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold">1. Return the original name</h3>
        <p>The bridge was Christened "The Tappan Zee Bridge"--why change it?  London Bridge was destroyed no less than four times, and each time, when rebuilt, it was still named London Bridge.  Why? Because it's London Bridge!</p>
        <h4>Mr. Cuomo, returning the bridge's original name would honor your father in a way that naming the bridge after him never would, could, or will.  Already, the news is calling what has happened "Bridgegate".  Your father would never in a million years want his name, or the name of his son, associated with a political scandal.  Why would you?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold">2. Name a stickball field after Mr. Cuomo, as he wanted.</h3>
        <p>When asked whether some sort of public monument should be named in his honor, Mario Cuomo reportedly replied, "I don't want anything." After a pause, he said, "Maybe a stickball court in Queens."</p>
        <h4>Mr. Cuomo, your father was a straight shooter.  He clearly said he didn't want anything named after him, or if anything, a stickball field in Queens.  He didn't say that as a coy way to cajole you into using tax money to rename the Tappan Zee Bridge?!  There's a HUGE difference between a community stickball field in an NYC borough in which he grew up and a huge public works project traversing counties he has no connection to and regarding a bridge that already has a name!  Once again, we urge you to reconsider, because if your intent was to honor your father... you failed.</h4>
        <h4>Meanwhile, there are quite a few kids in Queens right now who could be learning about teamwork, leadership, and good health if you had just done what he had asked...</h4>
      </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold">3. Create a Mario Cuomo bike and walking path on the Tappan Zee Bridge</h3>
        <p>The bridge has two spans, and plenty of room to create a beautiful walking and bike path in Mario Cuomo's name.  This way, we can honor Gov. Cuomo without destroying our history.</p>
        <h4>Mr. Cuomo, your father would far prefer something like this named after him.  It's something that rich and poor can use, for those with cards, and also for those without cars.  This is the type of honor your father deserves: one that lifts up his name, not one that tarnishes both his and yours.</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold">4. Call it the Cuomo-Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge</h3>
        <p>Why should one person's name be removed in favor of another?  That makes no sense.</p>
        <h4>Mr. Cuomo, your father put Governor Wilson's name on the bridge for a reason.  And he had the good sense not to remove the Tappan Zee name in so doing.  Why don't you follow in your father's footsteps and make a decision the preserves history, instead of the one you made that destroys it?</h4>
