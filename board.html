            <p>Jimmy grew up in the Albany area, but his adventures in undergrad and business school took him to NYC on a regular basis, and each time, he'd drive over the Tappan Zee Bridge. Jimmy is passionate about business, and is currently working in that field, but he is now also passionate about preserving history for future generations.  He believes that it is imperative that we know about the people that came before us, recognizing the shoulders on whom we now stand, and learning about the world in which we grew up through the living history that still stands before us.  In his free time, Jimmy enjoys traveling, scuba diving, and golfing... and snowboarding when it gets too cold to be out on the course!

            <p>
              Cherish was raised in Rockland County, NY, where her formerly German, French and Scottish immigrant ancestors settled several generations ago.  Her great-grandfather, former Superintendant of Schools, drove across the Hudson River in his early model Ford when the river froze and there was no Tappan Zee built.  Dr. Hopf made it safely across and since then, the Hudson River and the Tappan Zee Bridge that spans it, existed as part of the family lore.  Educated in Germany, Japan and Honolulu, Cherish returned to Rockland from Hawaii to raise a family.  She is grateful for her worldly education and feels fortunate to speak three languages and to have lived, studied and worked on several continents.  Cherish has lived in several cities in Japan, having studied then worked as an English language teacher for Princeton University. She became a scholar of Japanese religion at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and was granted an audience with the Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan, to present her work on Japanese weddings.  Back in the United States, her expertise in educational administration and marketing is notable, having worked for some of the top advisory and research organizations, private schools and law schools in the region.  She is a published writer, speechwriter and is currently working on a screenplay and a book.  Cherish is the proud mother of two children who attend Rockland county schools.</p>
