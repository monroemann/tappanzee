            <p>Ray, married since 1969 to his wife Connie, as well as father and grandfather, attended high school in Elmsford, and graduated with a BBA from Pace College in 1968.  He served his country with pride in the US Air Force from 1969-1971, achieving the rank of Sergeant.  After starting a career with Chicago-based Vogue Tyre & Rubber Co in 1972 as a salesman, after 44 years, he retired as the Northeast Regional Vice President. Vogue Tyre was established in 1914 providing premium products to the automobile dealers as well as to the public. In 1974, Ray moved from salesman to sales manager; in 1976 he became General Manager; and in 1993, he was promoted to Vice President. He grew the company immensely by introducing innovative new procedures, by setting up satellite locales in the NY/NJ metro area, by negotiating 3 union contracts with the UAW, and for locating real estate for two 40,000 sq. ft. locations handling all renovations with the builders.  Ray also has extensive board experience, as he currently serves on the board of the Westchester Seniors Golf Association which provides scholarships to caddies in the Westchester area.
