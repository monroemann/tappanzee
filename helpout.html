    <p>From the desk of (full name, address, zip code, email, and phone number)</p>

    <p>Dear _________________,</p>
  
    <p>I am writing to you in support of NY State Senate Bill S7671 & NY State Assembly Bill A8914, both of which would rename the current Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge to the far more appropriate Governor Mario M. Cuomo Tappan Zee Bridge, and save us countless tax dollars by avoiding the replacement of all the signs.</p>

    <p>I am one of the over 108,000 people who signed the petition on Change.org and I believe that the Tappan Zee name needs to remain a part of the new bridge, and if you don’t support this beautiful compromise, then YOU are the one being partisan.  Here are some more reasons why you should support it:</p>

    <p>1.  History matters.  The bridge was originally named for the founders of New York: the Tappan Indians of the Lenape Nation and the Dutch settlers (Zee means ‘sea’ in Dutch).  Did you know that the official seal of New York City depicts a Dutch trader and a Lenape Indian? The history of that bridge name is so important.</p>

    <p>2.  Public infrastructure should never be named after politicians, or not until at least that individual has been deceased for 50 years.  For a sitting governor to use his position of power to ram through a bill that names a bridge (that we payed for, and will pay for) after his politician father is a gross abuse of power and the definition of corruption.  We want the traditional name returned to the bridge’s name.</p>

    <p>3.  Just because it’s a replacement bridge does not mean it deserves a new name.  London Bridge was destroyed and rebuilt four times and never did politicians decide to give it a new name simply because they ‘could’.  What happened during the signing of ‘The Big Ugly’ is inexcusable.  If you signed that bill, you should be ashamed of yourself.  If you didn’t, why haven’t you been fighting like we have to get the name back?</p>

    <p>4.  Additional Reasons: (optional):</p>

    <p>Senate Bill S761 and Assembly Bill A8914 are an opportunity for you to right an obvious wrong.  This bill represents an opportunity to honor Mario Cuomo without destroying 70 years of local history and over 350 years of NY history.  It’s a fair compromise that I am asking you to please get behind: either by publicly supporting and/or simply voting for it.</p>

    <p>I kindly expect a response to this letter informing me of what action(s) you intend to take to help us save our Tappan Zee Bridge.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
